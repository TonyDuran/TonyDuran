Currently, Iâ€™m working on my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science @ Georgia Tech (OMSCS), while working full-time and a father!

Youâ€™ll usually find me exploring tech, solving tricky problems, or diving into security challenges. My interests bridge application security, finance, operating systems, and software engineering. 

Feel free to connect, ask questions, or just say hello!
